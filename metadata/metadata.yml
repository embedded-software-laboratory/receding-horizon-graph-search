  This is the code capsule for the paper with the title:
  Reducing Computation Time with Priority Assignment in Distributed Control
  Abstract:
  This article presents an approach for priority assignment in priority-based distributed control with the goal of minimizing computation time for the networked system. The coupling graph of the system becomes a \ac{dag} through priority assignment. From this \ac{dag}, a topological order can be derived. The number of levels in this topological order has a large influence on the computation time of the networked system. We present an approach which uses graph coloring to determine priorities which minimize the number of levels in the topological order.
  The approach is applied to trajectory planning for networked vehicles.
  The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown in theoretical and numerical examples.
